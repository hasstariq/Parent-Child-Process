$ indicates a command line prompt. Do not copy it when running the following material.

To rename Makefile,gmk to Makefile, run:

$mv Makefile.gmk Makefile

Makefile is in the same folder as your .c file to compile run

$ make

This will compile your program with warnings turned into errors. If you instead run

$ make warnings_OK

This will compile your program with warnings enabled but not fatal. If successful (ie gcc didn't complain) you should now have a file name Assignment_1 (with no file extension)

Try running
$./Assignment_1

and see what happens. It should fail with an appropriate error message

To run it properly use
$./Assignment_1 sample_in.txt

Some notes are already posted in previous lectures on Makefiles, Ina addition https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html has a decent reference on make files.
